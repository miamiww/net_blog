Oh what a tangled web we weave. I'm not really sure what's going on with this one or how I got here, I wanted to explore a search I had seen on Shodan called "3cx servers bcn" but now I'm trapped in a digital hall of mirrors. [3CX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3CX_Phone_System) is a private telephone exchange that sometimes runs over [VoIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP), and has servers that typically tend to run on 5001.

## Ï…Î·ÎºÎ·Î¿Ï‰Î· Î¹Î´ÎµÎ·Õ¥Ï„Î³ on 62.23.216.99
So I looked for things running on ports 5001. One of the first ones I saw was named "Ï…Î·ÎºÎ·Î¿Ï‰Î· Î¹Î´ÎµÎ·Õ¥Ï„Î³" which, naturally, got me pretty interested.

Going to their IP in a browser automatically tried for https but had a certificate error, and I was really struck by the url for which their certificate had been issued, which is to say that nyc-212.odin.biz sounds fake as hell. Thanks to [Azealia Banks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3Jv9fNPjgk) I know that 212 is an area code for NYC so at least that checked out with the phone theme. Let's come back to odin.biz in a bit.

Proceeding along to the IP prompts a login for Ï…Î·ÎºÎ·Î¿Ï‰Î· Î¹Î´ÎµÎ·Õ¥Ï„Î³. The login page is very pretty, there is a beach and some birds in the foreground and some mountains in the background. Again, we'll come back to this page later.
![](/images/100Days/Day20/unknown.png)
The login looked so nice I suspected that it must have a URL.
```
ðŸ‘»ðŸŒµðŸ”® $ host 62.23.216.99
99.216.23.62.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer mail.mx.vu.
```
Aha mail.mx.vu! So this is doing email or something related. What's mx.vu? It doesn't resolve to anything in the browser. According to Shodan it's in Garden City, Kansas.
```
ðŸ‘»ðŸŒµðŸ”® $ host mx.vu
mx.vu has address 209.200.39.39
mx.vu mail is handled by 10 mail.mx.vu.
mx.vu mail is handled by 20 syno.hno3.de.
ðŸ‘»ðŸŒµðŸ”® $ host syno.hno3.de
syno.hno3.de has address 89.246.70.219
ðŸ‘»ðŸŒµðŸ”® $ host hno3.de
hno3.de has address 80.237.132.25
hno3.de mail is handled by 50 mx0.hno3.de.
ðŸ‘»ðŸŒµðŸ”® $ host mx0.hno3.de
mx0.hno3.de has address 89.246.70.219
```
syno.hno3.de and hno3.de are both in Germany, unsurprisingly.
First hno3.de. It's running a page that just shows the following.
![](/images/100Days/Day20/hno3.png)

We'll get back to that one. Loose threads feel like they are piling up yet? Feel like there is a lot of Ï…Î·ÎºÎ·Î¿Ï‰Î· Î¹Î´ÎµÎ·Õ¥Ï„Î³ still to be explored? syno.hno3.de is running on 443 with the following webpage:
![](/images/100Days/Day20/syno.png)
Just giving a 403 error. Usually that comes after a failed login meaning that you didn't have the correct credentials, and I was wondering if this page were looking for a specific IP to interact with it. I went looking for such a thing and found what was checking whether or not to give the error, a long javascript function embedded in the page that was determining whether or not to send the 403. It began like this:
```
/* Copyright (c) 2018 Synology Inc. All rights reserved. */

(function(){var a=new XMLHttpRequest();a.open("get","/missing",true); ...
```
Synology Inc! Major clue. And that page requires a specific request to be made via the url, which I was /missing. [Synology makes network attached storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synology_Inc.) as well as a router and a couple of other network goodies.
![](/images/100Days/Day20/server.png)
Now let's get back to the Ï…Î·ÎºÎ·Î¿Ï‰Î· Î¹Î´ÎµÎ·Õ¥Ï„Î³ login. That page had a fair amount of javascript in it for a simple login page, much of it copyright Synology Inc.
![](/images/100Days/Day20/copyright.png)
There was also some from other companies, but they seemed to be doing web services and web design work, so it had likely been contracted out by Synology.
![](/images/100Days/Day20/lots.png)
So this login is probably for another Synology device, maybe storing mail.

But let's get back to odin.biz shall we?
```
ðŸ‘»ðŸŒµðŸ”® $ host nyc-212.odin.biz
nyc-212.odin.biz has address 62.23.216.99
```
That's the same IP that I had originally found. So mail.mx.vu is nyc-212.odin.biz. odin.biz however is considerably different from mx.vu. mx.vu doesn't appear to be hosting any web page of any kind, while odin.biz is hosting the same kind of thing as hno3.de!!
![](/images/100Days/Day20/odinbiz.png)
It turns out this is the default page for any server set up with [Host Europe GmbH](https://www.hosteurope.de/en/), which is the host for these pages. So someone set up these servers and parked default servers on the domain names and are using the domains to direct to a bunch of other servers via [CNAME](https://ns1.com/knowledgebase/comparing-alias-and-cname-records), some of which overlap. How deep does this go?

```

Too deep. Ï…Î·ÎºÎ·Î¿Ï‰Î· Î¹Î´ÎµÎ·Õ¥Ï„Î³ remains as such. See you tomorrow.


PS another fun airplane traceroute today.
