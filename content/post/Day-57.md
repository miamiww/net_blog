Yes today I Shodaned myself. Nothing shows up for my full name, thankfully, but "alden" has a lot of results.

## The Weather Underground on 35.160.169.47
I picked a result in Boardman, Oregon, largely because of how charming it was. It's just a [telnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet) server, running on port 23 and mirrored on port 3000. You almost never see telnet anymore these days, since it's been primarily replaced with the much more secure ssh. Here I am loggin in via `netcat`

[The Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/)! I'd actually heard of them before, they were the first weather service attached to the internet for the use of the public. Apparently it [started as a telnet service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Underground_(weather_service)#History) back in 1991, became a fairly successful weather company and highly visited website by the mid 00s, and is now owned by IBM. But the telnet service stays on. I like that.

And now I see why this result came up when I searched for my name, it's provided by [Alden Electronics](http://www.alden.com/), a manufacturer of all kinds of weather related gadgets.

I'd come across them before, because they own alden.com, a domain name that I'd clearly benefit from more. Figuring I'd give the old telnet service a spin I checked the forecast for New York City.

Unfortunately some of their help pages have gone missing. I'd have loved their guide on how to set up your own telnet service, but I might have been the first person to check that in several years. I'm not surprised it's gotten lost somehow.

I guess I'll have to find some other guide. See you tomorrow.
