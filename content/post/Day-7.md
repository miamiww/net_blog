Someone tried to phish me yesterday via text from a Los Vegas phone number. Fortunately I was able to figure out their IP address and, yes, their IP is on Shodan.

### Someone Trying to Phish Me on 146.120.89.201

I started out checking both Ð½Ð¾Ð¼Ðµ.Ñ€Ñ„ and xn--e1ance.xn--p1ai, which is the address the text message actually links to. In case you are wondering, and don't want to read further, Ð½Ð¾Ð¼Ðµ.Ñ€Ñ„ is safe to go to in a browser but xn--e1ance.xn--p1ai is definitely not. Possibly because .Ñ€Ñ„ and xn--p1ai seem like [rare top level domains](https://cctld.ru/en/), `nslookup` and `whois` didn't give me very interesting results. Apparently .xn--p1ai is an "administrative group" of .Ñ€Ñ„

Oddly I found that they both traced to the same IP address, 146.120.89.201, with a hostname of hosting18.ukrnames.com

I'm sure that [ukrnames](https://www.ukrnames.com/) is totally legit and aboveboard as a web hosting service but I couldn't help being reminded of a conference talk I had been to by [Brannon Dorsey](https://radicalnetworks.org/archives/2017/participants/brannon-dorsey/) talking about how Ukranian hosting services were the only way to completely anonymously buy web hosting via crypto currencies. This IP [shows up on Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/host/146.120.89.201) being in the domain of [Alfa Telecom](http://alfatelecom.cz/) in the Czech Republic. Using `nmap` reveals that they've got a lot going on.

```

What is all this stuff? All this time I hadn't yet opened up these addresses in my browser because I was a little nervous about what I'd find, so I checked them with curl instead.

```
ðŸ‘»ðŸŒµâœ¨$ curl Ð½Ð¾Ð¼Ðµ.Ñ€Ñ„
<html><head><META HTTP-EQUIV="refresh" CONTENT="0;URL=/cgi-sys/defaultwebpage.cgi"></head><body></body></html>
ðŸ‘»ðŸŒµâœ¨$ curl hosting18.ukrnames.com
<html><head><META HTTP-EQUIV="refresh" CONTENT="0;URL=/cgi-sys/defaultwebpage.cgi"></head><body></body></html>
ðŸ‘»ðŸŒµâœ¨$ curl xn--e1ance.xn--p1ai
<script language="JavaScript">
  window.location.href = "https://nnxoe.topgirlshere.com/c/da57dc555e50572d?s1=22177&s2=96501&s3=new_1&j1=1&j3=1"
</script>%                                                                    
```
Aha!! So Ð½Ð¾Ð¼Ðµ.Ñ€Ñ„ and hosting18.ukrnames.com both go to the same default nginx server page (if you can't tell from those results those domains auto redirect to cpanel's default page saying that perhaps that page's IP address had changed). But xn--e1ance.xn--p1ai is just a page with a script that auto redirects you to something called "topgirlshere". Well I have a pretty good guess what lies down that road.

But what is the endgame of this text message scam? And why do they have so much else going on with their server? And how can an IP have so many domains attatched to it? See you tomorrow.
