Another IoT home device today. At this point I'm picturing the people with these things basically having a [Wallace and Gromit style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqGTtFIZm5Y&t=65) lifestyle (note: I do have a wifi plug and yes this is my lifestyle). This one was inspired by another search I didn't recognize, for "Sonoff".

## A Sonoff wifi enabled plug on 87.20.184.148
[Sonoff is a company](https://sonoff.itead.cc/en/) that makes IoT plugs and switches, as well as a couple of models of IoT fans and light bulbs. What's interesting about Sonoff is that many of their cheapest switches are just [ESP8266 boards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266) with a casing, [making them very](https://tzapu.com/sonoff-firmware-boilerplate-tutorial/) [easy to hack](https://medium.com/@jeffreyroshan/flashing-a-custom-firmware-to-sonoff-wifi-switch-with-arduino-ide-402e5a2f77b).
![](https://github.com/arendst/arendst.github.io/blob/master/media/sonoffbasic.jpg)
I just picked the first Sonoff that showed up in my Shodan search, in Italy. Shodan said it was running a web app on port 80, so I checked it out in a browser.

The firmware's out of date! Probably should get that taken care of. More interestingly there is a big old Toggle button calling out to be toggled. If it's a switch that probably turns the current on and off so I resisted.

Looking up Sonoff-Tasmota I found that it is a [homebrewed version of the Sonoff firmware](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota), so this device is either a hacked Sonoff original or a [Sonoff clone running off of someone's ESP8266 board](https://community.blynk.cc/t/sonoff-clone-mini-esp8266-power-ac-relay-controller/9549/4). Let's check out that console!
![](/images/100Days/Day15/console.png)
Looks like it's mostly been taking commands via [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/). Looking more closely... there's the wifi name! "Angelozzi". Well what could we do with that information? Check it on [WiGLE](https://wigle.net/index) of course!
![](/images/100Days/Day15/wigle.png)
WiGLE is a global database of wifi and cell networks, promising "All the networks. Found by Everyone." They tag SSID names and other information to latitude and longitudes. And yes it looks like they had six wifi networks named "Angelozzi", three of which were in New Jersey, one in Canada, one in South Africa, and yes, one in Italy. In Bologna. Again I get the vertigo of overconnection.

I decided to give it an `nmap` just for good measure.
```
ðŸ‘»ðŸŒµðŸ”® $ nmap -p-  87.20.184.148
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-01-18 12:33 PST
Nmap scan report for host148-184-dynamic.20-87-r.retail.telecomitalia.it (87.20.184.148)

```
As soon as I did though I noticed that something weird was happening on the console: the Sonoff had lost connection with whatever device had been MQTTing it?
![](/images/100Days/Day15/whoops.png)
What this because I'd started flooding it with ping probes? Possibly? It seemed to be able to connect again once my scan was done. After a little fiddling around with these ports I found that the Sonoff device was talking with an [open source home automation system called Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), which must be the device it's MQTTing to at 192.168.1.100, using [the classic MQTT port of 1883](https://mqtt.org/faq).
![](/images/100Days/Day15/homeassistant.png)
[It's probably running on a Raspberry Pi](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/). See you tomorrow.


PS here's my tavel traceroute, from Bru Coffee in LA to Bologna, Italy.
