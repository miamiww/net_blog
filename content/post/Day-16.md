I'm pretty busy today with Processing Day so I'll keep today's short. Shodan may be best known for finding strangers' webcams, but I hadn't gone for one yet because early on in this project I decided that on days when I don't have a lot of time I'd just find an unsecured webcam and grab a still image. Today is one of those days.
