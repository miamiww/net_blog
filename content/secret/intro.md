![The Pink Pill: what if the Internet rabbit hole lead to a politics of compassion and openness?](/images/Misc/pill.gif)
Welcome, friends.

This is a website about the Internet. To get started, you can visit some of my [favorite stories](/tags/best-of/), or simply browse around some of the [classic yarns](/tags/classic-yarn/). 

The classic stories are all from work I was doing on [Shodan.io](https://www.shodan.io/) in early 2019, when I had challenged myself for a 100 days project to find one thing connected to the Internet each day and learn absolutely everything I could about that thing. It became a practice I began to refer to as One Way Long Distance Friendship: one way, because the things I was finding had no knowledge of me; long distance because they were over the Internet; friendship because my goal was to develop a deep appreciation for the thing and the people connected to it. The daily practice was extremely rewarding but also exhausting, and so after the 100 days I decided to take a break from the practice. I hope you enjoy what you read, and if you do, let me know and maybe I will get started again. Feel free to email me with feedback or story tips, you can find my address on my [website](https://thea.riven.ooo).
